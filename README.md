# Big data management using Spark

Given a log file that records HTTP requests (GET and POST) sent to a set of servers, you are asked to compute descriptive statistics on the amount of data (payload) communicated through such requests. These statistics need to be computed for each base URL (e.g., "http://subdom0001. example.com") in the log and the results must be reported in bytes. More specifically, you need to compute the following statistics per each sub-domain):
Minimum payload: The smallest payload communicated for each base URL. Maximum payload: The largest payload communicated for each base URL.
Mean payload: Mean of payloads for each base URL.
